Core features:
* Syntax highlighting for over 120 programming/markup languages
* Undo/Redo
* Light and dark themes
* Navigation buttons

UBports:
* Multiple tabs
* Adaptive layout
* Code autocompletion and snippets

Sailfish OS:
* Read only mode

## Architecture

Application for each platform consists of two major parts:

1. Platform-specific application  
    The application provides UI using native components, interacts with file system and contains WebView to inject editor engine

1. Web-based editor engine  
    HTML5 application optimised for mobile WebView runtime

The two components interact using a simple message-based API.
In Sailfish OS messages are delivered using `navigator.qt.postMessage` API, UBports uses webpage URL and direct JS calls

## Directory structure

* `harbour-seabass` - QML application for Sailfish OS
* `ubports-seabass` - QML application for UBports
* `editor` - JS editor engine

## Build instructions

Requirements:

* Node.js, tested using v12
* Sailfish SDK (for Sailfish OS)
* clickable (for UBports)

Build steps:

1. Build editor engine  
   1. Install editor dependencies and build tools: `npm install`
   1. UBports only: remove `ubports-seabass/qml/html` directory if exists (required only once when updating sources from ubports-seabass@v0.1.x)
   1. Build editor engine and copy required files to Sailfish/UBports app directory: `npm run build`
1. Build App  
   * Sailfish OS: build `harbour-seabass` using Sailfish SDK
   * UBports: build `ubports-seabass` using clickable

## Contribution

Like the Seabass? Would like to see new features implemented?
Awesome! There are numerous ways you can support the development.

First of all, your reviews, bug reports and feature requests are very appreciated!
As so pull requests :-). If you'd like to contribute, the [wiki](https://github.com/milikhin/seabass2/wiki) might be useful. It contains notes on project's architecture and some non-trivial workarounds applied.

There are a few labels used to indicate issue progress.
* `help wanted`: in my opinion, the issue worth fixing, but I'm not going to fix it myself due to its complexity, time required, if I just don't know how to fix it, or everything above. Pull requests are welcome if you'd like to see the feature implemented!
* `wontfix`: in my opinion, the issue requires to much work out of the project's scope or too many workarounds for SDK issues. Pull requests are still welcome though. It might be worth discussing implementation beforehand if there going to be lots of changes.

## Becoming a sponsor

Seabass is a free software. You can support the development using [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mmmikhael) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/mmmikhael/5). Donations helps to find time for resolving non-critical issues and implementing new features.

The more supporters the project gets, the more development time it gets.
And if it doesn't... Well there be updates and new features on a regular basis anyway! Just less often.

Issues that are scheduled to be fixed in the nearest releases has milestone label attached.
